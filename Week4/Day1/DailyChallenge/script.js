//Create an array using forEach that contains all the usernames from the gameInfo array, add an exclamation point (ie. “!”) to the end of every username.

//2. Create an array using forEach that contains the usernames of all players with a score bigger than 5. Use the ternary operator
//The new array should look like this :

let winners = ["becky", "susy"]
let gameInfo(score)= x;
let winners=console.log(x<5? username)


//3. Find and display the total score of the users. (Hint: The total score is 71)
